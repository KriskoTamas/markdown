# Terminology

## Monolith architecture
A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. The word “monolith” is often attributed to something large and glacial, which isn't far from the truth of a monolith architecture for software design.

## Microservice architecture
Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of **small independent services** that communicate over well-defined APIs.

## Monolith vs Micro service architecture
A monolithic application is built as a ***single unified unit*** while a microservices architecture is a collection of smaller, ***independently deployable services***.

## Container orchestration tool
Container orchestration tools provide a framework for managing containers and microservices architecture at scale.

## Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open source **container orchestration tool** that manages containers, helps manage containerized applications.

Kubernetes includes built-in commands for deploying applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs, monitoring your applications, and more, making it easier to manage applications.

## Container

## Cluster
A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications.

## Node

### Master node
A master node is a node which controls and manages a set of worker nodes (workloads runtime) and resembles a cluster in Kubernetes.

### Worker node
Worker nodes within the Kubernetes cluster are used to run containerized applications and handle networking to ensure that traffic between applications across the cluster and from outside of the cluster can be properly facilitated.

## Pod
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

## Kubelet

## ETCD

## Docker
Docker is an open source **containerization platform**. It enables developers to package applications into containers - standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

Developers can create containers without Docker, but the platform makes it easier, simpler, and safer to build, deploy and manage containers.
